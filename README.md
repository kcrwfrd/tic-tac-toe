# Tic-Tac-Toe
Two computers play each other in an automated game of Tic-Tac-Toe. When the game finishes, print the board and the game result--a win for X, a win for O, or a draw.

A full board should never be printed unless the final move is a game-winning move. If the game is going to end in a draw, end the game and print the board.

The program should run until X or O has won 10 games, and then finally output the amount of time it took to run the simulation.
